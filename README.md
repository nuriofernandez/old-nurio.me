# NURIO.ME's PHP version website

This is the source code of my website. This website was developed around 2015 and has had small modifications since then.
It is old, it looks old, but it is stills awesome. üíûüç°

# Component based

Without using any framework, I wrote some code to make it possible, each file can be considered as a component, something like React but much smaller.

# Single page application

With the script [`dynamic-page.js`](https://github.com/xXNurioXx/old-php-nurio.me/blob/master/src/assets/js/dynamic-page.js) the page turns into a [single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) without any external framework.

# Image loading optimization

With the script [`post-load-optimizer.js`](https://github.com/xXNurioXx/old-php-nurio.me/blob/master/src/assets/js/post-load-optimizer.js) the page loads a lighter version of the image on the first load, once the load is complete, it will load the images in full quality.

# Dango daikazoku („Å†„Çì„ÅîÂ§ßÂÆ∂Êóè) easter egg

With the script [`dango.js`](https://github.com/xXNurioXx/old-php-nurio.me/blob/master/src/assets/js/dango.js) the page plays the best song of the world and shows the best thing in the world falling around when someone types `dango` anywhere in the website.
