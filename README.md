# NURIO.ME's PHP version website

This is the source code for my old PHP based website. This website was developed around 2015 and has had small modifications since then. Now, I am moving it to ReactJs as it allows me to develop the website based on components in a better and beautiful way.

# Component based

I didn't use any framework at all, I just write some code to make it possible. With that, you can use each file as a component, something like React.

# Single page application

With the script [`dynamic-page.js`](https://github.com/xXNurioXx/old-php-nurio.me/blob/master/src/assets/js/dynamic-page.js) the page turns into a [single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) without any external framework.
